#the rules of naming variables in python
#a name given to a partition through programmng is called a variable
num1 = 65 # num1 is a variable
num2 = 100 # num2 is a variable
print(num1)
print(num1+num2)
#a variable name should not start with a special character e.g @num or #num !num
#compound varible names should not have paces e.g num 1 or num 2, my num
#compound variable names should be joined by either an underscore or a camel case or notation e.g my_num or num_1
#avoid using capital letters to be in the variable name e.g Num1 or Num2
#don't use special words as variable names e.g print or input,if while,for,if,else,elif,try,except,finally,raise,assert,import,from,as,pass,return,del,global,nonlocal,lamda,or,not,and,in,is,with,break,continue,class,def,or,else,elif,True,False,None
#python is case sensitive with variable names e.g Num1 is different from num1
#a coomplete instruction to a computer is called a statement(in line 3-6)
#a statement that evaluates to a result is called an expression(in line 6)
#a python file is called a script
#a group of statement is called a code
#a group of related code is called a block
#a block of code in a python script is called a program
# the running or implemmenting of the program is called execution
#the process of creating a variable is called declaring a variable
#the process of giving a value to a variable is called initializing or assigning
#the semantics is the meaning of the written code
#the syntax is the structure of the written code
#a list is a collection of values in a single variable and it is identified witha square bracket[]
# a value is called an operand
#the coversion of one data type to  value is called typecasting
